Welcome to Applied, where users can keep track of jobs they've applied to, making their job search simpler. This app uses the MERN stack, Mongo/Mongoose, Express, React, NodesJS to give users a seamless experience. We also included Adzuna's up-to-the-minute employment data to power our own website, reporting data.

This website was created by React's framework for building interactive user interfaces and web applications quickly and efficiently with significantly less code than you would with vanilla JavaScript.
